# Goa

Goa (*Golang Oriented to Aspects*) is a Golang library that provides us aspect-oriented programming (AOP).

## What's AOP?

> In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification

* Extracted  from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming)


## Goals

- Provide a handy tool that helps us to build reusable aspects.
- Code generation based in AST modifications
- A mechanism to build golang applications under AOP paradigm. 


## How does Go work?

Goa is mainly bassed in AST manipulation of our code. The steps are:

1. Take the defined aspects in our code.
2. Inspect both the functions and methods.
3. Check which functions and methods match with defined aspects.
4. From the current AST, It makes the required changes and save the generated code

The generated code is transparent for us, and this is completely functional. 

# Getting Started

## Installation

Add Goa dependency to your go.mod

**go.mod**
```text
module github.com/wesovilabs/goa-examples/greetings
...
require github.com/wesovilabs/goa <goa.version>
...
```

> Released Goa versions are available [here](https://github.com/wesovilabs/goa/releases)

In case of you're working with Glide or GoDeps you can add Goa to your project as described:

**Glide**
```bash
glide get github.com/wesovilabs/goa
```

**Go dep**
```bash
go get github.com/wesovilabs/goa
```

## Usage

## Guides & Tutorials

## Roadmap

# For Collaborators

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/wesovilabs/goa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.

## Checkout the code

In order to work on a Goa enhancement or on a bug fix you just need to fork the repository.

Once you forked the repository you can checkout it locally. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<user>/goa.git
```

## Setup Git hooks

All the commited code must pass tests and linter checks. These are defined with golangci. To ensure
your committed code will be valid to be merged you can setup some Git hooks by running

```bash
make init
```

## Running the tests

Run the tests with the below command

```bash
make test
```

and to check the test coverage... 

```bash
make test-coverage
``` 

> Keep in mind that for approval a Pull Request the test coverage must be equal or higher than the existing one.

## Check your code

As it was mentioned on the above, the code must pass all the defined linter checks. You can check it locally

```bash
make lint
```

## Build an executable

To generate an executable of Goa for your current os you just need to run:

```bash
make run
```
Alternatively you can do cross compiling by running. The below command will generate Goa executables for linux, darwin and 
windows.

```bash
make build-all
``` 

Linters configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/wesovilabs/goa/blob/master/.golangci.yml)
