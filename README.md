# Goa

Goa (*Golang Oriented to Aspects*) is a Golang library that provides us aspect-oriented programming (AOP).

## What's AOP?

> In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification
